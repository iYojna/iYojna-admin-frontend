# iYojna Admin Frontend
**An easy to access and easy to use application made for the common person to access govt. schemes.**

## About
Our idea is to make a mobile app for citizens who wish to know about gov. schemes and a web app for the gov. agencies to add schemes (with req details). Also we will use web scraping to gather scheme data from various gov. websites and portals.

A user will register on the mobile app using their name, age, gender, income etc. Next, they can view their eligible schemes (with recommendations) and can query for schemes (chatbot). Querying could be done in the following ways - 1. Tags and predefined categories. 2. Natural language-based query string. 3. Photo of scheme's pamphlet as the query. Selecting a scheme will show the user all data of the scheme like benefits given, application process, documents needed, offices to apply at (shown on a map).

All places of input in our app would be text & voice-based (selected by user) along with feedback regarding what was entered. English & Gujarati will be supported in our app. This will make our app accessible to the illiterate, deaf and blind.

**This repo contains the admin frontend source code of the iYojna app, for government agencies.**
